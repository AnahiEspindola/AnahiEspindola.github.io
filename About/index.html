				</p>I am from Argentina but I currently live and work in beautiful Moscow, ID (USA). I studied Biology at the University of Córdoba (Argentina) and at the University of Neuchatel (Switzerland). I obtained my Masters in Evolutionary Entomology at the  <a href="https://www2.unine.ch/evol/page-6423_fr.html;jsessionid=0B41C4C1095C4062D6516E24044BF894.corvus1">E-vol lab</a> at the University of Neuchatel, working on the populations genetics of tri-tropic interactions (plant-herbivore-parasitoid interactions>.</a></p>
				</p>My Doctoral research investigated the comparative phylogeography of obligate and specialized plant-pollinator interactions in Europe. In particular, I could perforn natural history, field and molecular research on two super exciting pollination systems: <em>Arum maculatum</em> and its lurring traps, and the nursery pollination system formed by <em>Trollius europaeus</em> and <em>Chiastocheta</em> flies.</a></p>
				</p>I continued working with these and other specialized pollination systems during a short post-doc in the <a href="http://www.unil.ch/dee/en/home/menuinst/people/group-leaders/prof-nadir-alvarez.html">Alvarez lab</a>, at the University of Lausanne.</a></p>
				</p>Thanks to two post-doctoral grants from the Swiss National Science Foundation, I could start my own independent research line. In collaboration with <a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~snuismer/Nuismer_Lab/">Scott Nuismer</a> and <a href="http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~jacks/">Jack Sullivan</a>, I now investigate the effect of the environment on the spatio-temporal dynamics of plant-insect interactions. To do this, I use the specialized oil-rewarding pollination interaction displayed between several <em>Calceolaria</em> species and their oil-collecting insects as models. My research tools consist of combinations of field surveys, experimental approaches in greenhouse conditions, phylogeographic analyses and morphometric methods.</a></p>
				</p>Since 2015, I am also working with Jack Sullivan, <a href="http://phylodiversity.net/dtank/Tank_Lab/PlantsOneZoom.html">Dave Tank</a> and <a href="http://carstenslab.org.ohio-state.edu/OSU/Carstens_Lab.html">Bryan Carstens</a> to study the comparative phylgeography of the temperate rainforests of the US Pacific Northwest, as well as developing tools to identify potential cryptic diversity in disjunct biomes.<a </p>
